        <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) </h1>
        <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli.</b> In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics
            at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, Introductio
            in analysin infinitorum (1748) remained a standard textbook for well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories
            of the time.
        </p>
        <p>One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula</p>
        <p>cos(x) + isin(x) = e<sup> (ix)</sup></p>
        <p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation</p>
        <p>e<sup>(&pi; i)</sup> + 1 = 0</p>
        <p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &pi;, e, and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement.</p>
        <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>

        <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cream together butter, sugar, vanilla, and flour.</li>
            <li>Press crust mixture into the flat bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, blend cream cheese and sugar. Beat in egg and vanilla. Pour cheese mixture over crust.</li>
            <li>Toss apples with sugar and cinnamon. Spread apple mixture over all.</li>

            <li>&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</li> <br> Nothing special. I like the crust, but there was a little too much of it for my taste, and I liked the filling but there was too little of it. I thought the crunchy apples combined with the sliced
            almonds detracted from the overall flavor. -- Reviewed on Sep. 1, 2010 by GLENDACHEF.

            Delicious!! I recommend microwaving the apples for 3 minutes before baking, to soften them. Great dessert - I'll be making it again for the holidays. -- Reviewed on August 28, 2010 by BBABS.
